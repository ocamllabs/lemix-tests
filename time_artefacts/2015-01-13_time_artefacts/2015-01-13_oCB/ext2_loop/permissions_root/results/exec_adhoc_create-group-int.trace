        # these tests create parent-directories with various permissions and
        # then try to create files and directories inside these parent
        # directories while being not the owner of the dir, but in the group
        # of it.  
        # This should only work, if one has search and 
        # write permission to the parent dir. However, the search permission
        # is also needed needed for path resolution. The tests therefore also
        # try to create the files in the current working directory. 
        # before removing x permission.

        # Pid 1 runs as root, we need 3 more processes that run 
        # as non-superusers. The idea is to have 
        #
        # - Pid 2 : creates and owns the directories
        # - Pid 3 : tries to create the files while 
        #           being in the right group but not the owner

    28: Pid 2 -> create (User_id 1) (Group_id 1)
    29: add_user_to_group (User_id 1) (Group_id 1)
